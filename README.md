# Game Development Projects with Godot 3 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Game Development Projects with Godot 3 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/game-development-projects-with-godot-3-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Godot is a free open source game engine that provides a huge set of common tools. This course is an introduction to the Godot game engine and its newly released version: 3.1. Godot 3.1 brings a large number of new features and capabilities that make it a strong alternative to more expensive commercial game engines. Godot is a powerful, customizable tool for bringing your visions to life.

In this course, you will learn to build projects that will help developers achieve a sound understanding of the engine when it comes to building games. This course can help you build on your foundation level skills by showing you how to create a number of small-scale game projects. Along the way, you will learn how Godot works and discover important game development techniques that you can apply to your projects. You will learn to develop cross-platform games, leverage Godot’s node and scene system to design robust, reusable game objects and also integrate Blender easily and efficiently with Godot to create powerful 3D games. Using a straightforward, step-by-step approach and practical examples, the course will take you from the absolute basics through to sophisticated game physics, animations, and other techniques.

Upon completing the final project, you will have a strong foundation for future success with Godot 3.1.
